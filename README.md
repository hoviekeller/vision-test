Vision Test is a simple and easy-to-use test for your eyes. It works based on the principle of how well you can see objects at 6 metes or 20 feet away.

The chart has an E character, which you need to decide the direction of the character only. Simply start the test and stand 1.6 meters or 5 feet away from the monitor. When you see a character on the screen, only decide the direction and wait for the answer to appear at the bottom of the screen. The answer is in green color and also a big font, so you can see it without any problems from distance.

In general, you need to correctly answer at least 50% of the characters at each level, and if you cannot, please stop at that level and record your score. You can adjust the test speed from the UI; the default time to read each character is 7 seconds.

Note: this test is NOT a clinical test for your eyes and has NO diagnostic values at all. It is just a very basic, simple and easy test for your vision's clarity and the result is good for your recordings only. You should NOT rely on the result of this test at all.
